                                <li>This love-struck guy would like to express all his love to this ravishing woman by using two simple words: Happy Birthday</li> 
                                 <li>All the wishes in the world can't describe the way I feel for you. And by that, I'd simply like to say Happy Birthday.</li> 
                                  <li>My friends say you're the one I fell blindly in love with, but, in fact, you are the light of my life. Happy Birthday, my love!</li> 
                                   <li>Sometimes I can't believe this cool, smart, dazzling girl is with me, but then your birthday comes & I know it's time to hold your hand and wish you happy birthday.</li> 
                                    <li>If I let myself express all that I feel for you, it would probably be literature. But I'm not a writer, I'm just this lucky guy that is trying to say Happy Birthday!</li> 
                                     <li>Your love is my life's music & the joy I see that I see in your eyes on your birthday is the absolute symphony. Happy Birthday and I love you in full harmony.</li> 
                                      <li>Here's my Birthday wish to you: May our love last as much as the light on the surface of the sun. Happy Birthday, girl!</li>
